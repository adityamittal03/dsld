\title{DSLDConditDisparity}
\description{
    This function, meant for Python users, uses the rpy2 library to call the R function dsldConditDisparity() from within a Python environment. 

    The function takes in a list of Python arguments corresponding to the arguments to the R function. These Python arguments are converted to R arguments     
    that are then passed into the R function. This way, the Python user can call the function similar to how an R user would call the function. 
    
    The R function, dsldConditDisparity(), generates a graph. In the python environment, an image of this graph is generated, saved, and automatically opened in an image viewer.
    The image is automatically removed shortly after being saved, so as not to take up space.

    For more information on the R function itself, please refer to its man page, which you can access through the command ?dsldConditDisparity
}

\usage{
    dsldConditDisparity <- function(data, yName, sName, xName, condits, qeFtn=qeKNN,
                            minS=50, yLim=NULL, useLoess=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
    \item{data}{
        If running from the terminal: A filepath to the csv file which holds your data.
        If running from the Python shell/prompt: A pandas or R dataframe that holds your data
    }
    \item{yName}{
        as in qeML functions, predictive variable, must be numeric
    }
    \item{sName}{
        name of the sensitive variable, an R factor
    }
    \item{xName}{
        name of a numeric column to take comparisons with
    }
    \item{condits}{
        an R vector; each component is a character string for an R logical 
        expression representing a desired condition; these must NOT involve sName
    }
    \item{qeFtn}{
        reg function (defaults only), defaults to qeKNN (IN PROGRESS)
    }
    \item{minS}{
        minimum size for an S group to be retained in the analysis, defaults to 50 (IN PROGRESS)
    }
    \item{yLim}{
        a 2-element vector specifying the lower and upper vertical plot limits, defaults to fit data (IN PROGRESS)
    }
    \item{useLoess}{
        if TRUE, do Loess smoothing on the regression values, defaults to TRUE (IN PROGRESS)
    }
}

\note{
    If the user intends to pass in an R dataframe by using R write.csv to generate a csv file which will be passed into this Python function,
    note that this process may create a csv with an extra column. This can significantly change the result.
}

\note{
    The usage of this function requires Python 3.10.

\examples{
# The dsldConditDisparity function aims to provide a seamless experience, requiring minimal effort to utilize its
# capabilities. Once the package is successfully downloaded and installed, the function can be leveraged by simply 
# employing similar commands shown in the examples.

#   Example 1:
#   Let's investigate the statistics about RECIDIVISM that generalize across race and fail to take into account 
#   specifics about underlying differences between subgroups (i.e. African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic). 
#
#   First, choose the COMPAS dataset. Make sure to convert the yName column to numeric before calling the function.
#   The function arguments here are (data = compas, yName = 'two_year_recid', sName = 'race', xName = 'age', 
#   condits = c('priors_count <= 4','decile_score>=6'), qeFtn = qeKNN).

    data(compas)
    compas$two_year_recid <- as.numeric(compas$two_year_recid == 'Yes')
    dsldConditDisparity(compas,'two_year_recid', 'race', 'age', c('priors_count <= 4','decile_score>=6'), qeKNN)

    # figures functionality coming soon
    # \figure{
    #   \includegraphics{man/Example1.png}
    #   \label{Example 1 Plot}
    # }

#   The blue (African-American) and red (Hispanic) curves exhibit the behavior that during middle age, the probability 
#   of recidivism declines. But the purple curve (Caucasian) shows the opposite. This shows the importance of exploring 
#   interactions between variables. Otherwise, we would have generalized that the probability of recidivism declines
#   during middle age for all races.

#   Example 2:
#   Let's investigate the same statistics about RECIDIVISM explored in example 1 but this time use a different qeML
#   function.

#   The function arguments here are (data = compas, yName = 'two_year_recid', sName = 'race', xName = 'age', 
#   condits = c('priors_count <= 4','decile_score>=6'), qeFtn = qeGBoost).

    data(compas)
    compas$two_year_recid <- as.numeric(compas$two_year_recid == 'Yes')
    dsldConditDisparity(compas,'two_year_recid', 'race', 'age', c('priors_count <= 4','decile_score>=6'), qeGBoost)

    # figures functionality coming soon
    # \figure{
    #   \includegraphics{man/Example2.png}
    #   \label{Example 2 Plot}
    # }

#   As you can see the curves generated by \code{qeGBoost} are similar to the curves in Example 1 using \code{qeKNN}. The use of any
#   of the qeML functions should give similar plots.

#   Example 3:
#    Let's investigate the statistics about RECIDIVISM that generalize across sex and fail to take into account 
#    specifics about underlying differences between subgroups (i.e. Female, Male).
#
#    First, choose the COMPAS dataset. Make sure to convert the yName column to numeric before calling the function.
#    The function arguments here are (data = compas, yName = 'two_year_recid', sName = 'sex', xName = 'age', 
#    condits = c('priors_count <= 4','decile_score>=6'), qeFtn = qeKNN).

    data(compas)
    compas$two_year_recid <- as.numeric(compas$two_year_recid == 'Yes')
    dsldConditDisparity(compas,'two_year_recid','sex','age',c('priors_count <= 4=10000','decile_score>=6'),qeKNN)

    # figures functionality coming soon
    # \figure{
    #   \includegraphics{man/Example3.png}
    #   \label{Example 3 Plot}
    # }

#   The blue (Female) curve exhibits the behavior that during middle age, the probability of recidivism inclines. But 
#   the red curve (Male) shows the opposite. This shows the importance of exploring interactions between variables. 
#   Otherwise, we would have generalized that the probability of recidivism declines during middle age for both sexes.

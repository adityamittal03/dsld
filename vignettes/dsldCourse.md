# Data Science Looks at Discrimination

##   Race, gender, age and so on.

Discrimination is one of the key social issues, in the US and in a
number of other countries.  There is lots of available data with which
one might investigate possible discrimination.  But how might such
investigations be conducted?

Our **dsld** package provides both graphical and analytical tools
for this purpose.  We see it as widely applicable; here are just a few
use cases:

* Quantitative analysis in social science courses.

* Corporate HR analysis and research.

* Litigation involving discrimination and related issues.

* Concerned citizenry.

# Data Science Looks at Discrimination

Statistical and graphical tools for detecting and measuring discrimination and bias, be it racial, gender, age or other. This can be in the estimation realm, say investigating a possible gender pay gap, or in a prediction context, with concern that an 
AI algorithm has built-in racial bias. This is an R package, with Python interfaces available. UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

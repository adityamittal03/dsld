## Determining Confounders

By now we know how to adjust for a confounder in our data. But how would we go 
about determining what can be a confounder in the first place?

Confounders, by their very nature, are a relationship between variables. It just
so happens that those relationships affect the relationships we want to see.

The easiest way to notice those relationships is to graph them. If a confounder
C is affecting the relationship between Y and S, there should be a graphical
trend between S and C.

Conceptual and Graphical Examples
How does graphing a confounder change how we look at the relationship between variables
Essentially, if we want to see the relationship between Y and S, but S and C look like they're correlated, there's a problem

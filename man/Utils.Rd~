\description{

Many functions in dsld are wrappers for functions in other packages. In
order to avoid "package bloat," we instead check for them as needed.
E.g. say a \code{dsld} function \code{f} wraps some function in package
\pkg{p}.  Then instead of listing \pkg{p} as imported etc. in the
\pkg{dsld} \file{DESCRIPTION} file, we write at the top of the \code{f}
function, \code{getSuggestedLib('p')}. This loads \pkg{p} if it is
installed on the user's machine, otherwise so informs the user.

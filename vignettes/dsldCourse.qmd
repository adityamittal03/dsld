Discrimination is a key social issue in the US and in a number of other
countries.  There is lots of available data with which one might
investigate possible discrimination.  But how might such investigations
be conducted?

Our **dsld** package provides both graphical and analytical tools
for this purpose.  We see it as widely applicable; here are just a few
use cases:

* Quantitative analysis in instruction and research in social science.

* Corporate HR analysis and research.

* Litigation involving discrimination and related issues.

* Concerned citizenry. 

This document provides a tutorial regarding applicable methodology, as
well as introduction to use of the package.

## Prerequisite background

In addition to having rudimentary skill in R, the user should have a
very basic [Python wrappers are included for most
functions.]{.column-margin} knowledge of statistical inference--mean,
variance, confidence intervals and tests, and histograms.  A "bare
bones" refresher, with emphasis on intuition, is given in Appendix A.

## The dsld package

The **dsld** package, which this tutorial uses for examples, has two
aims:

* To enable exploratory analysis of possible discrimination effects
through various graphical and tabular functions.

* To enable formal statistical analysis of such effects via addition of
a number of group-comparison operations to general R functions
such as **lm()** and **glm()**, thereby facilitating comparisons across
races, genders and so on.

# Introduction and Motivating Examples

To set the stage, consider the following:

## UC Berkeley discrimination claims 

![](SatherGate.jpg){width=15%}


UC Berkeley was accused of discriminating against female applicants
for graduate school, and indeed the overall acceptance rate for women
was lower than that for men.  This seemed odd, given Berkeley's liberal
reputation.

However, upon breaking the data down [This data is included in R, as the
built-in dataset **UCBAdmissions**.]{.column-margin} according to the
program students were applying to, it was found that in every
department, the female acceptance rate *within that department* was
either higher than the male rate or of similar level.  The problem:
women were applying to more selective programs, causing their overall
rate to below that of men.

## US Census data {#sec-census}

![](USCensus.png){width=25%}

The **svcensus** dataset is a subset of US census data from back in 2000,
focusing on six engineering occupations.  [Included here in the **dsld**
package.]{.column-margin} The question at hand is whether there is a
gender pay gap.  Again, the overall pay for men is higher, by about 25%.
But what if we break things down by occupation?  Though it does turn out
that some occupations pay more than others, and that men and women are
not distributed evenly among the occupations, there still is a gender
pay gap, of about 16%.

## Commonality

In both examples, we have an outcome variable Y of interest--acceptance
rate and wage income--and a sensitive variable S, which was gender in
both examples.  But in both cases, were concerned that merely comparing
mean Y for each gender was an oversimplication, due to a possible
*confounder* C--department in the first example, occupation in the
second.  Failure to take confounders (there can be more than one, and 
usually are so) into account can lead to spurious "relations" between S
and Y.  

::: {.callout-note}
### Confounder Adjustment Settings

So, in general, we wish to investigate the impact of a sensitive
variable S on an outcome variable Y, but *accounting for confounders* C.
Let's call them "confounder adjustment" settings.

:::

Now contrast the above examples with a different kind:

## COMPAS recidivism data

COMPAS is a commercial machine learning software tool for aiding judges
to predict recidivism by those convicted of crimes.  A 2016 [**Pro
Publica**
article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
investigated, finding  the tool to be racially biased; African-American
defendants tended to be given harsher ratings--i.e. higher estimated
probabilities of recidivism--than similarly situated white defendants.

Northpointe, the firm that developed COMPAS, [disagrees with the *Pro
Publica*
analysis](https://www.equivant.com/response-to-propublica-demonstrating-accuracy-equity-and-predictive-parity/),
and we are not supporting either side here.  But if the COMPAS tool were
in fact biased, how could the analysis be fixed?  

**A key point is that any remedy must not only avoid using race directly,
but must also minimize the impact of variables O that are separate from
race but still correlated with it, known as *proxies*.**  If, say,
educational attainment is correlated with race, its inclusion in our
analysis will mean that race is still playing a role in our analysis
after all.  

::: {.callout-note}
### Fair ML Settings

Thus our goal is to predict the outcome variable Y, without 
using the sensitive variable S, while making only
limited use of the proxy variables O.

:::

## Summary:  the two kinds of discrimination analysis covered here

This COMPAS example falls in the category of *fairness in machine learning ML*.

Note the difference between accounting for confounders on the one hand,
and fair ML on the other.  Here is a side-by-side comparison:

## Summary of symbols

We'll use X to denote the rest of the variables, i.e. those that are 
related to Y but are not S, C or O.  The general terminology is that Y
is variously termed the *outcome variable*, *target variable* or
*dependent variable*; the X, C, S and O variables are known collectively
as *covariates*, *features* or *independent variables*.

## Format of this tutorial

We treat the topics in this order:

* adjusting for confounders

* fair ML

Within each of the above topics, we cover:

* graphical and tabular exploration

* formal quantitative analysis

In each case, we present explanations of the relevant concepts, so that
this is a general tutorial on methodology for analysis of
discrimination, and show the details of using our **dsld** package to
make use of that methodology.

So, let's get started.

# Part I:  Adjustment for Confounders

How do we adjust for confounders?  The most common approach involves
[There will also be the question of *which* possible confounders to use.
]{.column-margin} linear models, with which we express the mean Y for
given values of the X, C and S variables in a linear form.  

## Example: a simple gender wage gap analysis

Consider the **svcensus** data example in @sec-census above,
investigating a possible gender pay gap.  So Y is wage and S is gender.
We might treat age as a confounder C, reasoning as follows.  Older
workers tend to have more experience and thus higher wages, and if there
is an age differential in our data, say with female workers tending to
be older, this may mask a gender pay gap.  

So, let's take the set of confounders C to consist of age, and for
simplicity in this introductory example, not include any other
confounders, such as occupation, and not include any other
variables X.

### Initial analysis

Our linear model would thus be

> mean W = $\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ A + $\beta$~2~ M

[The column svcensus$gender is an R factor. Our function **dsldLinear**
calls R's **lm**, which replaces that column by a dummy variable
**gendermale**, our M above.]{.column-margin} where W is wage, A is age
and M is an indicator variable, with M = 1 for men and M = 0 for women.
The parameters $\beta$~i~ are estimated by fitting the model to the
data:

```{r}
svcensus1 <- 
   svcensus[,c(1,4,6)]  # age, wage, gender
z <- dsldLinear(svcensus1,'wageinc','gender')
coef(z)  # print the estimated coefficients b_i 
```

Let's use b~i~ to denote our estimated $\beta$~i~.  So for instance b~1~
[Always keep in mind that statistical quantities are only estimated,
since we work only with sample data from some population, real or
conceptual.  Hence the need for standard errors, confidence intervals
and so on.]{.column-margin} 
= 489.5728 is our estimate of the unknown population parameter
$\beta_1$.

### Interpretation of $\beta$~2~

Lots in the output to discuss, which we will gradually cover below.  For now, note that the estimate b~2~ turns out to be about $13,000, which is the (estimated) wage gap, if any.  Here's why:

Under the model, the mean wage for, say, 36-year-old men is

> $\beta$~0~ + 36 $\beta$~1~ + 1 $\beta$~2~ 

while for women of that age it is

> $\beta$~0~ + 36 $\beta$~1~ 

The difference is $\beta$~2~.  But if we look at, for instance, people of age
43, the mean wages for men and women are

> $\beta$~0~ + 43 $\beta$~1~ + 1 $\beta$~2~ 

and

> $\beta$~0~ + 43 $\beta$~1~ 

and the difference *is still* $\beta$~2~.  

::: {.callout-note}
Thus we can speak of $\beta$~2~ as *the* gender wage gap, at any age.
According to the model, younger men earn an estimated $13,000 more than
younger women, with the *same-sized* gap between older men and older
women.
:::

The above approach to dealing with confounders is a very common one.
But it raises questions, such as:

* What are the assumptions underlying that model?  And how might we [In
  addition, the data here are, as is commonly the case, *observational*,
  as opposed to being the result of a *randomized clinical trial*; there
  may be serious issues, due to unobserved confounders.  Such problems
  might be solvable via an advanced (and rather controversial)
  methodology known as *causal inference*.  Unfortunately, details are
  beyond our scope in this tutorial, but we will explain some basic
  concepts in @sec-causal.]{.column-margin} check whether they are
  (approximately) valid?

* We chose only one C variable here, age.  We might also include
occupation, as noted earlier.  In some datasets, might have dozens of
possible confounders.  How do we choose which ones to use in our model?
And for that matter, why not use them all?

* The above model, in which the gender wage gap was uniform across all
wages, may not be adequate.  How can we determine this, and what
alternative models might we use?

### Statistical inference

The full output of **dsldLinear()** goes to the heart of discrimination
analysis, enabling statistical inferences on differences in levels of
the sensitive variable S.  Let's take a look, continuing from the above
code: 

```{r}
summary(z)
```

The first half of this output is from **lm()**, which is called by
**dsldLinear()**.  The second half is the "value added" material 
from **dsld**.

So, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the gender wage gap is
[Since the estimated gender gap here is simply b~2~, the CI could of
course have also been obtained directly from the **lm** half of the
output.  But with an S having more than two levels, e.g. race, the
**dsld** enhancement is quite valuable.]{.column-margin}

> 13098.2091 &plusmn; 1.96 x 790.4451

or (11548.94,14647.48).

### With-interactions model

As discussed above, in our model

> mean W = $\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ A + $\beta$~2~ M

we identified b~2~ as *the* difference in mean wage between men and
women, regardless of age, so that for instance:

> According to the model, younger men earn about $13,000 more than younger
> women, with the same-sized gap between older men and older women.

But that may not be true.  On the contrary, gender discrimination and
[Interaction between two types of discrimination is called
*intersectionality* by some analysts.]{.column-margin}
age discrimination may interact.  It may be, for instance, that the
gender gap is small at younger ages but much larger for older people.

Technically, the with-interactions model adds a product term:

> mean W = $\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ A + $\beta$~2~ M + $\beta$~3~ AM 

So for example, the gender pay gap for people of age 36 is

($\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ 36 + $\beta$~2~ 1 + $\beta$~3~ 36) -
($\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ 36 ) =

$\beta$~2~ 1 + $\beta$~3~ 36

And at age 43, the gap is

$\beta$~2~ 1 + $\beta$~3~ 43

So, this model does indeed allow for interaction between age and gender.

However, this added-product-term is a bit abstract, and it is easier
(and approximately equivalent) to simply fit two linear models, one for
men and one for women.

::: {.callout-note}
The **dsldLinear** function includes an argument **interactions**. The
default value is FALSE, but if TRUE, it fits separate linear models for
each level of S.  An additional argument 'newData' is now
needed, through which the user specifies a data frame consisting of
one or more (X,C) values at which to compare the effect of S.
:::

```{r}
newData <- data.frame(age=c(36,43))
z <- dsldLinear(svcensus1,'wageinc','gender',interactions=T,
   newData)
summary(z)
```

So the gender pay gap is estimated to be -13156.88 at age 36, -13039.27
at age 43, only about $100.  The estimated gap between ages 36 and 53,
not shown, is larger, close to $300, but it seems there is not much
interaction here.

### S may consist of more than one factor 

### Assessing linearity 

As noted, linear models are ubiquitous in observational data analysis.
Open any professional journal in medicine, sociology, economics and so
on, and you'll see many applications of this methodology.  But how would one
check that most basic assumption, the linearity of the mean Y for given
X, C and S values?

::: {.callout-note}
### Assumptions--not just a formality

Assumptions *matter*.  They are never perfectly satisfied, but failure
to be even approximately valid can mean deciding that there is no
discrimination when it actually is there, or vice versa.  It can mean
bad medication being declared by the government as good, or vice versa.
In litigation, if a key expert witness is exposed by opposing counsel as
not having checked the assumptions in his/her analysis, the side for
which the witness was testifying will likely lose the case on the spot.

:::

Typically, linearity is checked graphically.  A common approach involves
plotting the *residuals*, which are the differences between the fitted
line and the Y values.  Here, though, we use another graphical approach,
via a **dsld** function that may be more informative. 

```{r}
dsldConditDisparity(svcensus1,'wageinc','gender',
   'age','age > 0',yLim=c(0,150000)) 
```

The function plots a smoothed graph of Y against a user-specified C
[The function has a 'conditions' argument; we have none here, so we just used a
trival one, 'age > 0']{.column-margin} variable, once for each level of
S.  So, the call here says, "Plot wage income against age, for each
gender."  

The model has mean Y being a linear of function of age, so we  should
expect to see approximate straight lines here.  Yet the relation
certainly looks nonlinear, possibly reflecting age discrimination
against both very young and very old workers.  We are already
investigating one kind of discrimination here, gender, so again for
simplicity let's keep age as a confounder.  

### Updated model

But we must do something about the substantial nonlinearity [Adding a
squared term does not make our model nonlinear, as it is still linear in
the b~i~; if we, say, double each of those, the entire expression is
doubled, the definition of linearity. The model is nonlinear in age but
linear in the b~i~.]{.column-margin} we've discovered,
and one possible remedy is to add an age^2^ term be added to the
equation:

mean W = $\beta$~0~ + $\beta$~1~ A + $\beta$~2~ A^2^ + $\beta$~3~ M

```{r}
svcensus1$age2 <- svcensus1$age^2
z <- dsldLinear(svcensus1,'wageinc','gender')
coef(z)  # print the estimated coefficients b_i 
```

So we see that the original wage gap figure of about $13,000 was
incorrect, underestimating it by about 15%.

We see in this example that misspecifying a linear model can have a
major impact on its accuracy.  Further issues of model assumptions are
beyond the scope of this book, but the interested reader is referred one
of the most popular applied linear models books, *Regression Modeling
Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic and Ordinal
Regression, and Survival Analysis*, by Prof. Frank Harrell, Jr. of the
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

### Other assumptions

Other than linearity, the standard errors reported by **lm()** also [It
is also assumed that wage income has a normal/gaussian distribution at
each level, but the Central Limit Theorem's implications for the sums
created by **lm()** are in fact approximately normal.]{.column-margin}
assume that variance of wage income is approximately constant across
ages and genders.  Lack of this property has some effect on the accuracy
of reported standard errors, but this can be adjusted via the so-called
*sandwich* operation, an option in **dsldLinear()**.

# Part II:  Fairness in Machine Learning

## Motivation
<!-- Don't know how accurate this is, please feel free to make edits -->
In modern applications of machine learning as a predictive modeling tool, it 
would be irresponsible to produce a model that biases one sensitive group over 
another. As such, it becomes imperative to find methods of reducing any such 
biases that a model might hold when it comes to modeling and predicting on 
sensitive datasets.

Of course, nothing comes for free: the inherent tradeoff of increasing fairness 
is reduced utility (predictive power over the dataset). Thus, a means of 
balancing this tradeoff between fairness and utility becomes essential in any 
future implementations of machine learning.

While there exists a plethora of methods for ensuring a fair machine learning 
model, the primary approaches utilized in the `dsld` package are:
    1. Engineering the data itself before modeling through deweighting
    2. Minimizing the impact of sensitive features in the model itself

The end result of this modified modeling process is a tool that allows users to:
    1. Compare a fair model against one with no fairness implemented; the 
       effective result is a means of uncovering if biases exist within the 
       dataset itself, but also how much fairness is gained for utility lost.
    2. Reduce the impact of any inherent discrimination within the data (of 
       course only to the level that is specified).

## Example
<!-- introduce running example + context... this example should most likely 
come from COMPAS -->

## Measurements of Fairness & Utility
Different algorithms and approaches attempt to reduce bias as indicated through 
different metrics. In the following subsection, our aim is to explain what each 
of these metrics tell users and which algorithms perform best with respect to 
each one.

### Fairness Metrics
<!-- compare all the fairness metrics against one another... -->

#### S-Correlation
<!-- correlation between S-feature and output -->

### Utility Metrics
<!-- compare all the utility metrics against one another... -->

#### Test Accuracies
<!-- accuracy results on test sets -->

#### ROC Curves
<!-- show a graph for this one... -->

#### F1-Score
<!-- compare against ROC -->

## Approaches Deployed in DSLD
<!-- go over all the approaches we use in the fairML & EDFair wrappers -->
<!-- compare their performance against each other across all metrics

# Appendices {.appendix}

## Appendix A: Fast Lane to Statistics


## Appendix B: A Note on Causal Inference {#sec-causal}

A common way to conduct causal inference is to show the effects of 
your variables in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Imagine we are investigating 
a possible relationship between smoking and developing cancer. A DAG of this
relationship would have an arrow from the "smoking" node to the "cancer" node:

![](appendixB/scdag.png){width=40%}

The direction of the arrow suggests that smoking causes cancer. However, this 
is not the only depicted effect -- both variables have a statistical effect on 
each other, despite the arrow being unidirectional (more on this later).

Suppose we suspect that older people are more likely to smoke and more
likely to develop cancer. A 3rd variable, age, can added to the DAG as follows:

![](appendixB/ascdag.png){width=40%}

Though it may seem counterintuitive given the arrow directions, we can actually 
trace a new path between smoking and cancer that goes through the "age" node -- 
this is called a *backdoor path*. This path does not depict a causal relation 
between smoking and cancer, but it illustrates some additional statistical 
effect between smoking and cancer. [Usually there are multiple criteria that must 
be met for something to be considered a confounder. We are not claiming that age 
is a confounder solely due to this DAG.]{.column-margin}This an example of 
confounding being shown via a DAG (where age is the confounder).

By controlling for this age variable, we can block this backdoor path from 
altering our causal inference (the possible causal relationship between smoking and 
cancer that we want to investigate):

![](appendixB/ascdagc.png){width=50%}
<!-- Cutting out this example since we think it's extra info -Taha -->
<!--
Let's say, hypothetically, that age was immeasurable, but we still wanted to account
for it since it could be confounding the potential causal relationship. To do this, 
we can add a new variable, tar, as an intermediate step between smoking and cancer: 

![](appendixB/astcdag.png){width=40%}

The bottom arrows all pointing in the same direction still indicates that smoking 
causes cancer, just through an intermediate step. But what about the relationship 
between smoking and tar? 

Of course, there is the direct (causal) path between smoking and tar, indicating 
that smoking causes tar formation in the lungs. More importantly, though, the 
backdoor path is blocked, regardless of whether we control for age. Thus, we have 
successfully isolated the causal path by accounting for age without measuring 
it!

![](appendixB/astcdagc.png){width=50%}

[Another example: as far as we know, there is no connection between contracting 
COVID and having appendicitis. However, someone with either conditions is more likely 
to be hospitalized than someone without COVID or appendicitis -- in other words, 
hospitalization is a collider in between the two conditions. Yet, if we attempt to 
control for this collider by only considering hospital patients, we would find 
(by surveying these patients) that those with appendicitis are less likely to have 
COVID. In other words, if someone was hospitalized, and they didn't have 
appendicitis, it becomes likely that their hospitalization is due to 
COVID.]{.column-margin}

However, this method can have unintended negative consequences. Since both tar 
and age both affect cancer, cancer is a a *collider* between 
tar and age. 

This collider indicates that there is no statistical effect between 
tar and age in the path containing cancer. And yet (perhaps 
counter-intuitively), if you were to control for cancer (i.e. by only
sampling those with cancer), you would find an inverse statistical relationship 
between age and tar.

So, while we *can* use an intermediate to account for an immeasurable confounder,
it is important to recognize that controlling for a confounder/collider could 
incorrectly indicate some statistical association between two otherwise unrelated 
variables.
-->

But how can we control for a variable that can't be measured like age? Lets assume 
that genetics can increase one's chances of becoming a smoker and one's chances of 
developing cancer. Even though genetics is immeasurable, we want to isolate the true 
causal effect between smoking and cancer. To do this, we can add a new variable, tar, 
as an intermediate step between smoking and cancer:

![](appendixB/gastcdag.png){width=40%}

The bottom arrows all pointing in the same direction still indicates that smoking 
causes cancer, just through an intermediate step. But what about the relationship 
between smoking and tar? 

Of course, there is the direct (causal) path, indicating that smoking causes tar 
formation in the lungs. More importantly, though, by controlling for the smoking 
variable, we can block the backdoor path between tar and cancer. 

![](appendixB/tcdag.png){width=40%}

The backdoor path between smoking and tar is also blocked since cancer is a collider 
for genes, age, and tar. Now, we have isolated the causal effects of smoking/tar and 
tar/cancer.

<!-- Might have to adjust the placement of this sidenote -Taha -->
[This intermediate method can have unintended negative consequences. Since tar and 
genetics both affect cancer, cancer is a a *collider* between tar and genetics. 
This collider indicates that there is no statistical effect between 
tar and genetics in the path containing cancer. And yet (perhaps

between genetics and tar. So, while we *can* use an intermediate to account for an 
immeasurable confounder, it is important to recognize that controlling for a 
confounder/collider could incorrectly indicate some statistical association between 
two otherwise unrelated variables.]{.column-margin}

![](appendixB/stdag.png){width=40%}

Combining the two (i.e. by multiplying the linear regression coefficients) 
gives us the causal effect of smoking and cancer *without* having to control 
for age or genetics!

<!--

-->

While our examples might still make causal inference seem very appealing, there is one
more big catch - we are assuming that these graphs are accurate to our data. 
Unfortunately, data isn't always simple enough for the relationships between variables 
to be depicted with just a few nodes and arrows. And as our data becomes more complex, 
it becomes harder justify certain decisions, like whether a variable X directly or 
indirectly (through some variable Z) effects another variable Y.

Even in a simple example, there seems to be no single correct answer in how a 
graph should be constructed. If we tried to model the DAG described in
the UC Berkeley discrimination claims, we would find two ways of doing so: either 
one's gender influences the type of department they apply to, 
or the type of department influences the majority gender of the people that 
apply to it. 

![](appendixB/gdadag.png){width=65%}

Both constructions seem valid, but they are wildly different 
interpretations. If we control for the department, under the first 
graph, we might underestimate the influence that gender and acceptance 
rate have on each other. Under the second graph, we are controlling for a confounder, 
thus isolating the true relationship of gender and acceptance rate.

Constructing an accurate DAG requires extreme depth of 
knowledge in the field you are analyzing. Two different experts in the same 
field can come up with two entirely different DAGs for a given scenario, with 
two different sets of variables that should be controlled. Thus, we could reach two 
completely different conclusions on our causal inference between variables.

Because there is no way to know the correct way to construct a graph, the 
credibility for this kind of analysis is questionable at best.

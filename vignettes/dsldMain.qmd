Discrimination is a key social issue in the US and in a number of other
countries.  There is lots of available data with which one might
investigate possible discrimination.  But how might such investigations
be conducted?

Our **dsld** package provides both graphical and analytical tools
for this purpose.  We see it as widely applicable; here are just a few
use cases:

* Quantitative analysis in instruction and research in social science.

* Corporate HR analysis and research.

* Litigation involving discrimination and related issues.

* Concerned citizenry. 

This document provides a tutorial regarding applicable methodology, as
well as introduction to use of the package.

## Prerequisite background

In addition to having rudimentary skill in R, the user should have a
very basic [Python wrappers are included for most
functions.]{.column-margin} knowledge of statistical inference--mean,
variance, confidence intervals and tests, and histograms.  A "bare
bones" refresher, with emphasis on intuition, is given in Appendix A.

## The dsld package

The **dsld** package, which this tutorial uses for examples, has two
aims:

* To enable exploratory analysis of possible discrimination effects
through various graphical and tabular functions.

* To enable formal statistical analysis of such effects via addition of
a number of group-comparison operations to general R functions
such as **lm()** and **glm()**, thereby facilitating comparisons across
races, genders and so on.

# Introduction and Motivating Examples

To set the stage, consider the following:

## UC Berkeley discrimination claims 

![](SatherGate.jpg){width=15%}


UC Berkeley was accused of discriminating against female applicants
for graduate school, and indeed the overall acceptance rate for women
was lower than that for men.  This seemed odd, given Berkeley's liberal
reputation.

However, upon breaking the data down [This data is included in R, as the
built-in dataset **UCBAdmissions**.]{.column-margin} according to the
program students were applying to, it was found that in every
department, the female acceptance rate *within that department* was
either higher than the male rate or of similar level.  The problem:
women were applying to more selective programs, causing their overall
rate to below that of men.

## US Census data {#sec-census}

![](USCensus.png){width=25%}

The **svcensus** dataset is a subset of US census data from back in 2000,
focusing on six engineering occupations.  [Included here in the **dsld**
package.]{.column-margin} The question at hand is whether there is a
gender pay gap.  Again, the overall pay for men is higher, by about 25%.
But what if we break things down by occupation?  Though it does turn out
that some occupations pay more than others, and that men and women are
not distributed evenly among the occupations, there still is a gender
pay gap, of about 16%.

## Commonality

In both examples, we have an outcome variable Y of interest--acceptance
rate and wage income--and a sensitive variable S, which was gender in
both examples.  But in both cases, were concerned that merely comparing
mean Y for each gender was an oversimplication, due to a possible
*confounder* C--department in the first example, occupation in the
second.  Failure to take confounders (there can be more than one, and 
usually are so) into account can lead to spurious "relations" between S
and Y.  

::: {.callout-note}
### Confounder Adjustment Settings

So, in general, we wish to investigate the impact of a sensitive
variable S on an outcome variable Y, but *accounting for confounders* C.
Let's call them "confounder adjustment" settings.

:::

Now contrast the above examples with a different kind:

## COMPAS recidivism data

COMPAS is a commercial machine learning software tool for aiding judges
to predict recidivism by those convicted of crimes.  A 2016 [**Pro
Publica**
article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
investigated, finding  the tool to be racially biased; African-American
defendants tended to be given harsher ratings--i.e. higher estimated
probabilities of recidivism--than similarly situated white defendants.

Northpointe, the firm that developed COMPAS, [disagrees with the *Pro
Publica*
analysis](https://www.equivant.com/response-to-propublica-demonstrating-accuracy-equity-and-predictive-parity/),
and we are not supporting either side here.  But if the COMPAS tool were
in fact biased, how could the analysis be fixed?  

**A key point is that any remedy must not only avoid using race directly,
but must also minimize the impact of variables O that are separate from
race but still correlated with it, known as *proxies*.**  If, say,
educational attainment is correlated with race, its inclusion in our
analysis will mean that race is still playing a role in our analysis
after all.  

::: {.callout-note}
### Fair ML Settings

Thus our goal is to predict the outcome variable Y, without 
using the sensitive variable S, while making only
limited use of the proxy variables O.

:::

## Summary:  the two kinds of discrimination analysis covered here

This COMPAS example falls in the category of *fairness in machine learning ML*.

Note the difference between accounting for confounders on the one hand,
and fair ML on the other.  Here is a side-by-side comparison:

  aspect      confounder adjustment   fair ML
  ----------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------
  goal        estimate an effect      predict an outcome
  harm        comes from society      comes from an algorithm
  side info   adjust for confounders  limit impact of proxies 

## Summary of symbols

We'll use X to denote the rest of the variables, i.e. those that are 
related to Y but are not S, C or O.  The general terminology is that Y
is variously termed the *outcome variable*, *target variable* or
*dependent variable*; the X, C, S and O variables are known collectively
as *covariates*, *features* or *independent variables*.

## Format of this tutorial

We treat the topics in this order:

* adjusting for confounders

* fair ML

Within each of the above topics, we cover:

* graphical and tabular exploration

* formal quantitative analysis

In each case, we present explanations of the relevant concepts, so that
this is a general tutorial on methodology for analysis of
discrimination, and show the details of using our **dsld** package to
make use of that methodology.

So, let's get started.  One key point first, though:

::: {.callout-note}
### Role of the software

This book makes use of the **dsld** software, but is definitely not a
user manual for that package.  Instead, it is a guide to the statistical
principles, with the software playing a supporting role.

A related point is that, unlike some readers may have experienced in
some statistics courses, real-world statistical analysis is not
conducted in a formulaic, "Step 1, Step 2,..." manner.  Instead,
decisions on say, which model to use, must be made by you, the analyst,
based on your overall assessment of the available information.
The software cannot make your decisions for you.

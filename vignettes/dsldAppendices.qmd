Once one has obtained a statistical estimator, say of a linear
regression coefficient,


## Appendix B: A Note on Causal Inference {#sec-causal}

An *observational study* is, in essence, one that is not planned. For
instance, say we are comparing an old and a new drug for hypertension.
Suppose that, unknown to us, the new medication does well on younger
patients but not on older ones.  Say the nature of the data collection
process results in disproportionately sampling older patients, but our
data itself does not include patient ages.  This could unfairly make the
new drug appear ineffective.

In a *randomized clinical trial* (RCTs), we would randomly assign
treatments to patients, so there would likely be no strong imbalance in
age distribution in the two drug groups.  So, even if our data still did
not record patient age, there would be no age bias in our analysis.

In many cases, RCTs are infeasible or impossible (we cannot "assign"
race).  *Causal inference* CI can be viewed both as a way to deal with
unseen variables in observational studies, and in its graphical forms,
as a descriptive alternative to traditional statistical relational
analysis.  Though CI takes on many forms, our discussion here will focus
on *directed acyclic graphs* (DAGs).  

### DAGS

In a DAG, an arrow from A to B signifies that A "causes" B.

For instance, a graphical description of a situation in which older
people (say who came of age before anti-smoking campaigns) might be more
likely to smoke, and for other reasons may be more likely to develop
cancer even if they are nonsmokers.  A graphical description would be

Here is an example the **bnlearn** package on our **svcensus** dataset:

``` r
   library(bnlearn)
   library(dsld)
   data(svcensus)
   svcensus$wageinc <- as.numeric(svcensus$wageinc)
   svcensus$wkswrkd <- as.numeric(svcensus$wkswrkd)
   svcdag <- iamb(svcensus)  # default argument values
   plot(svcdag)
```

![](svcensusDAG.png){width=100%}

There are a couple of undirected arcs, e.g. between gender and [Though
again we omit a detailed treatment of CI DAGs here, we note that that
field defines a confounder of two variables as a variable that is an
"ancestor" to both, education being a confounder for income and
occupation.]{.column-margin} occupation--found to be relations, but 
with indeterminate direction, using available data.

More interesting, though, is the lack of a causal arc from gender to
wage income.  This is in stark contrast to what **dsldLinear** suggests:

```{r}
data(svcensus)
w <- dsldLinear(svcensus,'wageinc','gender',interactions=FALSE)
coef(w)
```

Here, even correcting for age, education and so on, we still find a
substantial gender pay gap.  Gender does seem to matter, on its own.

It should be noted that if the **bnlearn** function **hc** is used
instead of **iamb** (not shown), there is indeed a link from 'gender' to
'wageinc', but apparently at the cost of other anomalies.  For example,
there is no arc, or path of arcs, from 'wkswrkd' to 'wageinc'.

CI DAGs are of course quite visually appealing, and many people find
causal concepts helpful in their thoughts processes regarding the data.
But as pointed out by the developers of such methodology, the graphs can
be very misleading.  Using DAGs effectively requires deep understanding
of the concepts.  A treatment of these concepts is well beyond the scope
of this course, but we urge users and consumers of CI to keep the
following points in mind:


* The definition of *cause* is of course central to proper use of CI
  DAGs.  It does *not* mean what one ordinarily thinks of as causal ("The
  sidewalk was icy, so the man slipped and fell"), and it can become quite
  complex; "wrapping one's head around" the definition can be a
  challenge even for experienced probabilistic modelers.

* Unseen variables, such as age in the above example, can be just as
harmful in CI contexts as in observational data.

* Causal analysis is just as much at the mercy of sample size as is
  classical statistical analysis, indeed even more so, since the causal
  version in effect estimates many more parameters.  Absence of a link
  may be due to insufficient data, and nonlinks at the population level
  may appear as "links" in our graph by random chance in small datasets.   

* Most important, DAGs have a highly concerning uniqueness problem:

::: {.callout-note}
### DAGS are not unique

* Most important, for any given dataset, there is typically no unique
  DAG: [CMU professor C. Shalizi has [bluntly
  noted](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/16/lectures/25.pdf)
  that in cases of nonuniqueness, presenting just one DAG without
  mentioning the equivalent ones, "...[which] is often what people seem
  to do," might be viewed as "lying by omission."  Recognizing the
  nonuniqueness is "simply a matter of scientific
  honesty."]{.column-margin} DAG.  Typically many DAGs can fit the
  dataset equally well, and they can be in conflict with each other.
  One DAG might say that A causes B, while another, equally credible in
  terms of data fit, might have B causing A, while a third says A and B
  are independent.

  M. Scutari, author of **bnlearn**, shows an example in his Cambridge lectures:

  ![](TwoEquivDAGs.png){width=100%}

  The nonuniqueness is of course very concerning.  In recent years, there
  has been much handwringing in science about the Replication Crisis, in
  which scientists try to replicate the findings of an earlier published
  paper, and discover serious problems with the earlier results.
  Imagine the replication problems that can arise if authors of a paper
  present just one of many equally-credible DAGs, as is usually the
  case.
:::

DAGs can indeed lead to valuable insight, but can be misleading as well.
A healthy skepticism and a solid understanding of the concepts are
mandatory for avoiding misleading or invalid results.

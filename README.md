# Data Science Looks at Discrimination

UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

Statistical and graphical tools for detecting and measuring
discrimination and bias, be it racial, gender, age or other. 
This is an R package, with Python interfaces available.

Analysis categories:

* In the estimation realm, say investigating a possible gender pay gap.

* In a prediction context, with concern that an AI algorithm has built-in
bias against some racial group.

In the first case, we are checking for *societal* or *institutional*
bias.  In the second, the issue is algorithmic bias.
